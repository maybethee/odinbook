## For Developers

If you'd like to explore or contribute to the codebase, you can set up the project locally by following these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Ruby** (with Bundler)
- **PostgreSQL** (or the database you're using)
- **Rails**

---

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

<!-- edit!! -->

```
 git clone https://github.com/maybethee/golf.git
 cd golf
```

3. **Set up the backend:**

- Install ruby gems:
  ```
  bundle install
  ```
- Set up the database:
  ```
  rails db:create db:migrate
  ```
- Start the Rails server:
  ```
  rails s
  ```
- By default, the backend will run on `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Access the app**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

<!-- ### Notes

- **Hot Reloading**: Changes in the React app will be reflected in real time, but backend changes will require you to restart the Rails server. -->
